Release : V1.0

- Implementation of IV sequence. It is used to generate a triangular waveform and trace the IV characteristic of the cell.
- Graph switching capabilities added to the single sequence.
- IV Graph added to the single sequence.
- Modification in the signal name of single sequence (SET low => Ramp; SET high => Pulse). The objective is to get a more general interface.
- Modification of the ramp generator in Controller. A negative ramp can now be generated using a negative ramp parameter.
- Modification of of the single voltage waveform generator, now all measurement are performed using 4-wire.
- The new cell format has been implemented : 600:1000:600:ddmmyyss:00x00.
- Default export PATH was modified.
- Some modifications were made on the GUI.
